# Intermediate Python Concepts
This Github repository contains intermediate level Python concepts that are commonly used in data analysis and visualization. The concepts covered in this repository include Pandas, Matplotlib, and Dictionaries.

# Getting Started
To get started with these concepts, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Additionally, you will need to install the following libraries:

1. Pandas : https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html

2. Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing.html
Once you have installed Python and the required libraries, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:


## Copy code to get clone 
       
        
             git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/intermediate-python-concepts.git


# Concepts Covered
The following intermediate level Python concepts are covered in this repository:
# Table of Functions for Pandas and Matplotlib

| Pandas | Matplotlib |
| --- | --- |
| `pd.read_csv()`: Reads data from a CSV file and returns a DataFrame object. | `plt.plot()`: Creates a line plot. |
| `pd.DataFrame()`: Creates a new DataFrame object from a dictionary, list of dictionaries, or other data structures. | `plt.scatter()`: Creates a scatter plot. |
| `df.head()`: Returns the first n rows of a DataFrame. | `plt.bar()`: Creates a bar plot. |
| `df.tail()`: Returns the last n rows of a DataFrame. | `plt.hist()`: Creates a histogram. |
| `df.info()`: Returns a summary of a DataFrame, including the data types of each column and the number of non-null values. | `plt.pie()`: Creates a pie chart. |
| `df.describe()`: Returns descriptive statistics for each column in a DataFrame. | `plt.boxplot()`: Creates a box and whisker plot. |
| `df.groupby()`: Groups a DataFrame by one or more columns and applies a function to each group. | `plt.table()`: Creates a table object in the current figure. |
| `df.merge()`: Merges two DataFrames on one or more columns. | `plt.subplot()`: Creates a subplot. |

### Dictionaries:
1. Creating dictionaries
2. Accessing and modifying dictionary items
3. Looping through dictionaries
